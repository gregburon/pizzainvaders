# pizzainvaders
Pizza Invaders was a quick delve into the land of making games for mobile devices. I originally was going to make an asteroids clone, but it quickly turned into more of a space-invaders sorta game. I never fully finished it, but it was a fun, quick project. It was written in Java with J2ME SDK and using Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP).
